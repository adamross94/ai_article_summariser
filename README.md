# Features

* Uses OpenAI's API: The app utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model through an API to perform content summarization on articles.
* Summarizes URLs: Users can input the URL of an article they want to summarize, and the app extracts the content from the URL for processing.
* Content Condensation: The app employs the GPT-4 model to analyze and condense the content of the article, generating a shorter summary while preserving the key information.
* Web Interface: Built using ReactJS, the app provides a user-friendly web interface where users can interact with the summarization functionality.
* Responsive Design: TailwindCSS is used to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface that adapts to various screen sizes and devices.
* State Management: Redux Toolkit is integrated into the app to manage the application's state, enabling efficient data management and interaction between components.
* Utilizes RapidAPI: The app interfaces with RapidAPI to access and manage the communication with OpenAI's API, facilitating the summarization process.
* Streamlined User Experience: By combining these technologies, the app offers a seamless experience for users to input URLs, receive concise article summaries, and navigate the interface.
